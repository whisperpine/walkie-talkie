# wt-rest-stubs

A rust library providing server stubs APIs using [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)
framework, auto-generated by [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).
It's dedicated to be a dependency of a rust server application.

DON'T modify files manually under this directory,
except for files listed in [.openapi-generator-ignore](./.openapi-generator-ignore).
If it's intended, modify OpenAPI Specifications under
[openapi](../openapi/) directory or [gen-rust-axum.sh](../scripts/gen-rust-axum.sh)
script, then run `just gen-axum` command to generate this package again.

## Feature Flags

The generated library has a few optional features that can be activated through Cargo.

- `server`
  - This is enabled by default and creates the basic skeleton of a server.
  - To create the server stack you'll need to implement the API traits.
- `conversions`
  - This defaults to disabled and creates extra derives on models to allow
    "transmogrification" between objects of structurally similar types.
